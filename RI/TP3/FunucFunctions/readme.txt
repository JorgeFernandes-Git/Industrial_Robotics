This Matlab minitoolbox was presented by Tomiła Tyczyńska and Daniel Costa
in 2015 for assignment TP3 in the Course of Industrial Robotics. It was used
on the FANUC LR Mate 200 iD robot. However, no guarantees are given and the
code should be used with caution and at the users' own risk.
Improvements and extensions to the toolbox are welcome.
